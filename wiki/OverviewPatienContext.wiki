#Introduction to why a the patient in needed.

= Introduction =

The patient context is a combination of a simple search interface and an portlet-event based message service. Though the portlet can be placed on multiple pages in the portal, each instance share a common context.

= The idea =

The patient-context is a little like a bunch of telepathic siblings. 

The happy people are the patient-context portlets. They each live on their own page, on that page each patient-context direct what other portlets should do. 
In the portal the patient-context's are share in one common mind.

= The reason why =

When you have many healthcare systems you want to make it easy to navigate between these systems, and pick up information about the patient at hand.

At the same time it is *very* important not to have any mixups. You should never risk while looking at a referral for one patient, flip a page and get a list of medications for the previous patient.

We need a mechanism that at the same time makes things simple and natural and at the same time prevents misstakes.

= The how =

== PatientEvent ==
The patient-context keeps track of a rather frugal set of data. The current active patient-identifier stored in a PatientEvent object and a history list of patient searches (PatientEvents) made in the current session.

== Patient identifier types ==
When a search are entered in the search window the text are matched against a predefined list of patient identifier types:
 * PersonNumber
 * ReservNumber (SäS, SU, NU)
 * SamordningsNumber
 * ...

If the text can be interpreted as one of these types, an object of that type will be created. If several of the types can match the input text a choice dialog will appear.

If the input text cannot be match too any of the identifier types, it can be used as is, without being typed in any way.

=== Patient identifier validation === 
The type validators can be quite liberal. For instance the PersonNumber validator accept invalid month, day or control number. PersonNumbers are used for search so it has to allow for errors entered in external systems, as long as it obeys some kind of regularity.

More person-identifier-types can be added as the need arise.

== Portlet events ==
When a search are issued a PatientEvent are created. This object are packaged in a portlet-event and sent for consumption of other portlets on the page.

It is up to the listener portlet to actually perform the search and retrieve and display the information, the patient-context portlet just announce that something *ought* to be done, *not what* has to be done.

Finally, when a PatientEvent search request are issued, an PatientContext changed event are issued. This event are to tell all the other patient-context instances on the other pages that something has changed. 

The PatientContext changed event serves two purposes:
 # Current patient (and history) has changed.
 # Invalidate the old patient information display.

= Integrations =

The patient-context also represents a sweet spot for integrations. 

I.e. if we want to log who has accessed information on what patient in which healthcare application - the patient-context is an obvious place. This can be accomplished  with either an independent Logging listener-portlet or as an full-blown integrated in the patient-context.

Another obvious integration could be context synchronisation with desktop systems like Journal3, and when it is in place NPÖ.

If the patient-context is used to synchronise everything inside the portal, there will only need to be *one* integration made, not one integration per healthcare application in the portal.
