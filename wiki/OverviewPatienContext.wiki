The patient context is a combination of a simple search interface and an portlet-event based message service. Though the portlet can be placed on multiple pages in the portal, each instance share a common context.

The patient-context is a little like a bunch of telepathic siblings. 

The happy people are the patient-context portlets. They each live on their own page, on that page each patient-context direct what other portlets should do. 
In the portal the patient-context's are share in one common mind.

= The reason why =

When you have many healthcare systems you want to make it easy to navigate between these systems, and pick up information about the patient at hand.
At the same time it is *very* important not to have any mixups. You should never risk while looking at a referral for one patient, flip a page and get a list of medications for the previous patient.
We need a mechanism that at the same time makes things simple and natural and at the same time prevents misstakes.

The patient-context keeps track of a rather frugal set of data. The current active patient-identifier stored in a PatientEvent object and a history list of patient searches (PatientEvent's) made in the current session.
