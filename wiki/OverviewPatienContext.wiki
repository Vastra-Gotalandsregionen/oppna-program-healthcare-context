The patient-context is a little like a bunch of telepathic siblings. 
The happy people are the patient-context portlets. They each live on their own page, on that page each patient-context direct what other portlets should do. 
In the portal the patient-context's are share in one common mind.

We need a mechanism that at the same time makes things simple and natural and at the same time prevents misstakes.
