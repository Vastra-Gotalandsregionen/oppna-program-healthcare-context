#Guide for installing and testing the Patient context portlet, making it available for other systems.

= Patient context =
== Introduction ==

The patient context parse and interprets user input, making it available to other systems/portlets through a JSR-286 portlet event. 

== Event class deployment ==
The event object has to be deployed separately from the portlet, and it has to be on the classpath of the application server.
Every portlet has it's own class-loader and if the event-class where to be deployed along the portlets depending on it, they would not be able to use it.

Tomcat:
 * copy {{{healthcare-context-patient-context-composite-webcomp-*.*.jar}}} to {{{<tomcat_home>/lib/ext}}}
 * verify that {{{commons-lang-2.4.jar}}} is in {{{<tomcat_home>/lib/ext}}}
